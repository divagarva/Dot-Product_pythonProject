# Dot-Product_pythonProject
 This Python project calculates the dot product of three vectors. Users input three vectors of equal length, and the program multiplies corresponding elements and sums the results. It ensures input validation, handles errors, and outputs the computed dot product, providing a simple and efficient solution.
